# Badger
CS 368 Final Project. A text-based game written in C++

To play, compile using: g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp

The commands for the game are accessible by typing "help" into the command window after setting up your player attributes.

This game was the semester-long project for CS 368 (Intro to C++) at UW-Madison.  My partner Jared and I spent countless hours working on this and I'm really proud of it.  The game's full title is "A Week in the Life of a Badger", which means that it's an adventure, decision-based game focused around one week in the life of a UW-Madison student. The game starts on a Monday morning where you wake up late for class and are asked if you want to actually go, or sleep through it.  Many decisions similar to this exist throughout the game that students are used to making.  Study on a Thursday night or go to the bar with your friends? In this game, you get to make all those tough decisions.  Players gain and lose points in four areas: grades, work, social life, and sleep.  Users also have a wallet that will eventually run out of money if they spend too much money and don't work enough.  The game utilizes a graph of several campus locations and allows users to walk between locations.

Since neither of us had created a large program like this from scratch, it was intimiating at first.  We began not by writing code, but by carefully planning much of our project.  We wrote out descriptions of the classes we would need, along with their methods and instance variables.  We also planned out the menu system that players use to interact with the game on the command line.  We used Git/GitHub to collaborate on the project, and it was developed in the CLion IDE.

I really enjoyed working on this project.  There were very few requirements, so it was a great excuse to try something new and have no boundaries!  Starting small and getting a simple version of the game working before moving onto advanced features was the right way to approach a project like this.  It was a great learning experience for both of us, as we had never extensively used Git/GitHub or the CLion IDE or C++ (hence why we took the class).  If I had more time to improve this project, I would try to take advantage of some of C++'s built in features, such as iterators and operator overloading.  Taking advantage of those would have resulted in cleaner code and less bugs.
